## Introduction

Aside from moonlighting as a highschool teacher, Vincent is a trader. It's in his blood. He can sense a change in basis points the same way his friends claim to be able to sense changes in emotions during a social interaction. 

He has identified an amazing new strategy, based on hours of careful research on Investopedia. He'll play M&A and profit off the sweet spread between acquisition cost and current stock prices. But what's this, sometimes M&A deals don't go through? Eventually he's going to get margin called? Nonsense, he'll just unwind the position and sink another Mountain Dew Code Red&copy;. 

Will Vincent achieve his return target of 254%? Will his venture capital backers grow tired of bailing out his margin call? Will Vincent become the de facto ruler of Barrick gold as a result of an error in his floating point arithmetic? Only time will tell.
